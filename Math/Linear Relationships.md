Linear Relationships are a relationship between two variables that, when graphed, is represented by a straight line.

Linear relationships can be expressed in graphical format or as a mathematical equation of the form $y = mx + b$, where:

$m = slope$
$b = y-intercept$

In the above equation, $x$ and $y$ are two variables that are related by the parameters $m$ and $b$. Graphically, $y = mx + b$ plots in the x-y plane as a line with the slope $m$ and a y-intercept $b$. The y-intercept is simply the value of $y$ when $x = 0$. The $m$ is calculated as:

$m=\frac {(x2​−x1​)}{(y2​−y1​)}$
