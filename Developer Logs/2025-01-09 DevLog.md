# Adding skeletal animation, FPS view, FSMs, and collisions

Over the last month I've spent a lot of time on my engine. While I didn't make any December notes, I've made a lot of progress on the engine still.

# Skeletal Animation

Skeletal animation is the process of grabbing relevant bone data and animation data from a model that is imported. The bone data works in a hierarchy where moving one part can influence other parts of the mesh based on a weight while the animation data is basically lerps and slerps (Linear Interpolation and Spherical Linear Interpolation) transformations done on the bones to achieve the act of animation. I've implemented Skeletal Animation in the pass, and it's about as far as I've got with Engine development, but this time it went a lot smoother as I was able to pick things up a lot easier.

With Skeletal Animation, I was able to render an FPS model that is holding a gun. There are some key events I've added as well such as reloading, walking, and running animations. These were all done with the help of Finite State Machines (Or FSM).

The FPS was done with the help of understanding the math behind transformations. Our engine's shaders were set up to transform everything relative to our projection matrix, so ridding of that, leaving just our view and model, gives us a model that does not leave our view space. Pretty neat but only a temporary solution.

You may have noticed that I am VERY far from my light and some objects. When I implemented collisions, it for some reason sends my character flying in the beginning. I have theories as to why this is happening, but for now nothing is implemented and I'll have to go in and fix the issue.

And that's all the progress I have made the last month. A lot of work has gone into the engine and I plan to add a lot more and learn a lot more.
