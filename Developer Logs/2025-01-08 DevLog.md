# New year, new projects!

Happy new years! As the start of the new year, I have decided to make a Roblox game. The aim for this game is to be able to learn how traditional engines work as well as learn the architecture in general so that I can learn how to make games in general. The game I have decided to start out with is a Vampire Survivors clone. After this, I have ideas for the type of game I want to make. It's been a while since my last note and this one is a bit of a short one, but this year is only going to be full of new learnings and possibilities. I've made a lot of progress on my engine as well that I will cover in the next!
