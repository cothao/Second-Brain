# Adding Text and an FPS Counter!

It's been a while since my last dev log! I'm excited to share that I've gone back to my engine and have been working on (and have) adding text to it. Now it took a while to do so,  but the results are smooth:

As you can see we're running at a smooth 84 fps for almost nothing on the screen. Not bad at all but could use a few tweaks to the engine to make it faster. To calculate the fps was a simple formula, just dividing the the total frame count by the elapsed time. This seems like it didn't work correctly as the fps does seem to creep up more and more over time, so I'll look into why this is happening (or maybe my computer is just that fast). It may be an issue with how fast the frame count is going up, so I may have to adjust the formula to fix this. Definitely will be the next thing I work on.

On another note, I am still working on shaders and will try to add something like rainy windows. I tried making a sphere with just the fragment shader but that didn't go too well, so when I gain more knowledge I'll come back to it. For now, I'll move forward to something like shifting to different modes (i.e Depth test mode, stencil buffer mode, etc.) to make testing the engine more immersive.
