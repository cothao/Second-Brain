# Training Arc Begins Now! (Again)

It's been a couple days since my last Developer Log. For the past few days I have taken a break from my engine and before moving onto the next thing have decided to work on my shading skills again. I was never that good at shading and thought it would be a good thing to develop as I grow as a graphic programmer. Shading is a fundamental and transferrable skill among graphics and it pays to be good at it (plus I wanna make cool looking stuff).

So far, I've been able to make a love emoji almost entirely on my own while trying to learn the concepts behind it. Here's what it looks like:

Not bad huh? I'm still taking time to make some notes on how a lot of the functions work behind the scenes, but for now this'll do.

I'm planning on moving a lot towards shader stuff before moving into my engine again. Wanna make something cool. Stay tuned!
