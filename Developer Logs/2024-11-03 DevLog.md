# Developer Log #1: Occlusion and Depth Testing

After rewriting a portion of my game engine (basically the whole thing), I now want to focus on making lighting more realistic. Currently, I have a basic Phong lighting implementation that works for all objects and models loaded in as well. The problem that I am currently facing is that while it does work, there is no depth testing involved, and so the lights added in tend to cast past the point of collision.

(As you can see, the crate is blocking the light source, yet the light still beams pass the crate and on to the other objects)

To fix this, I have been attempting to implement occlusion. Occlusion is the effect of one object in a 3D space blocking another object from view. Right now there is occlusion implemented via the Depth Buffer, but we want to make sure that it works with lights as well. How I plan on fixing this may require using the Depth Buffer to Depth Test the light and see if there are obstacles with a larger Z component than others, if that's the case then we won't need to do any light calculation on those further objects.

# UPDATE

Occlusion for lighting may be done a little later down the road as it also deals a bit with Shadow Mapping (which I haven't currently learned) but I will get there when I get there.
