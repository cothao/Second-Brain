# Edit Modes

I haven't had much time recently to work on much of my engine, so I worked on a little project within it. The project involved being able to switch between different modes (normal, wired, depth, etc.) to be able to see the scene in different ways. While I have implemented it for the most part, I still haven't been able to implement the depth test mode and will get to it later. Here is a look at the current modes:

(Just the standard mesh draws with texture and everything)

Wired Mode:

(This is just changing the draw call to draw lines only, super simple)

Changing to a wired mode was simple, but interchanging between the two was hard. I had made a Mode enum but couldn't increment it, so I had to operator overload the increment operator to be able to do so as well as wrap around once it reached the end. Harder than it sounds but I got it working.

That's pretty much what I've done for this week. Not much, but I promise there will be more cool stuff to show soon.
