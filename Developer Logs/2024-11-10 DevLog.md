# Continuing with Shaders and 3D

Last developer log I had mentioned that I have been playing a lot more with shaders to understand the underlying math as well as shader programming more to become a better graphics programmer. 

Playing with it has actually helped me understand some of the concepts I had trouble with and helped me understand how to created better shaders as well. I even created a 3D cube in the fragment shader:

I've made a note in my Computer Graphics section detailing how it was done, but it's almost the same as creating a perspective matrix and camera within OpenGL.

So yeah, still working on shaders. Will finish up some notes and get back to my engine soon though. I plan on working on my shader knowledge, math knowledge, and opengl knowledge together, so that I have a good foundation of all, so stay tuned.
